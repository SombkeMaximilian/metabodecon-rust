/// Peak detection algorithm based on the second derivative of the signal.
///
/// This algorithm detects peaks in a signal by analyzing its second derivative,
/// which captures changes in curvature and transitions in signal behavior, such
/// as local extrema and changes in concavity
///
/// In the tables below, `x` marks the position of the peak center or border
/// under consideration, and `-` represents adjacent data points included in
/// the sliding window.
///
/// In the future, this may be extended into a trait to allow for customizable
/// peak detection strategies.
///
/// # Peak Centers
///
/// A peak center is defined as a point where the second derivative is negative
/// and where the second derivative is at a local minimum. This means that the
/// signal is concave down (curving upwards), and the curvature is decreasing in
/// both directions.
///
/// The indices are offset by +2 to align with the corresponding signal data
/// points, as the second derivative can only be computed for inner points of
/// the signal intensities, and the conditions for a peak center can only be
/// checked for a second derivative data point with neighbors on both sides. For
/// example, with 10 signal intensity data points, the second derivative is
/// computed for the 8 inner points, and the peak centers can be found at
/// indices 2 to 7. The peak centers are then scanned with a sliding window.
///
/// | Signal Intensities | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
/// | ------------------ | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
/// | Second Derivative  |   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |   |
/// | Potential Centers  |   |   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |   |   |
/// | Step 1             |   | - | x | - |   |   |   |   |   |   |
/// | Step 2             |   |   | - | x | - |   |   |   |   |   |
/// | Step 3             |   |   |   | - | x | - |   |   |   |   |
/// | Step 4             |   |   |   |   | - | x | - |   |   |   |
/// | Step 5             |   |   |   |   |   | - | x | - |   |   |
/// | Step 6             |   |   |   |   |   |   | - | x | - |   |
///
/// # Peak Borders
///
/// ## Right
///
/// A right border is a point where the second derivative is increasing relative
/// to the previous point and either remains greater than or equal to the next
/// point, or transitions from negative to non-negative curvature at the
/// subsequent point. This behavior in the second derivative reflects the
/// transition of the signal's curvature from concave down to flat or concave
/// up, marking the boundary of the peak region. The index is computed relative
/// to the peak center, i.e. to get the global index, the peak center index must
/// be added. In other words, the peak center is at index 0 for this reference
/// frame.
///
/// | Index relative to center | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
/// | ------------------------ | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
/// | Step 1                   | - | x | - |   |   |   |   |
/// | Step 2                   |   | - | x | - |   |   |   |
/// | Step 3                   |   |   | - | x | - |   |   |
/// | Step 4                   |   |   |   | - | x | - |   |
/// | Step 5                   |   |   |   |   | - | x | - |
///
/// ## Left
///
/// A left border is defined analogously to a right border. Likewise, the index
/// is computed relative to the peak center. However, the indices have to be
/// interpreted as negative indices. Using negative indices provides a
/// consistent way to analyze points relative to the peak center. The peak
/// center is at index 0 for this reference frame again.
///
/// | Index relative to center | -6 | -5 | -4 | -3 | -2 | -1 | 0 |
